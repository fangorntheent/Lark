Cat #10,
	You are in charge of feeding yourself because it is your job to hunt 
	the birds that eat my flowers.
	I have nine other cats just like you so I don't care if you starve.
	If you want to eat you had better work hard.
	If you survive for two weeks, I might bother to learn your name.
Fond regards,
	Gertrude
