CHMOD(1)                  BSD General Commands Manual                 CHMOD(1)

NAME
     chmod -- change file modes or Access Control Lists

SYNOPSIS
     chmod [-fv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] mode file ...
     chmod [-fv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-a | +a | =a] ACE file ...
     chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-E] file ...
     chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-C] file ...
     chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-N] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The chmod utility modifies the file mode bits of the listed files as
     specified by the mode operand. It may also be used to modify the Access
     Control Lists (ACLs) associated with the listed files.

EXIT STATUS
     The chmod utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

MODES
     Modes may be absolute or symbolic.

     For example, the absolute mode that permits read, write and execute by
     the owner is +rwx.

     The symbolic mode is described by the following grammar:

           op           ::= + | - | =
           perm         ::= r | w | x

      The perm symbols represent the portions of the mode bits as follows:

           r       The read bits.
           w       The write bits.
           x       The execute/search bits.

     The ``w'' permission on directories will permit file creation, reloca-
     tion, and copy into that directory.  Files created within the directory
     itself will inherit its group ID.

EXAMPLES OF VALID MODES

     +X            make a directory or file searchable/executable by everyone
                   if it is already searchable/executable by anyone.
