CAT(1)                    BSD General Commands Manual                   CAT(1)

NAME
     cat -- concatenate and print files

SYNOPSIS
     cat [-benstuv] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The cat utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard
     output.  The file operands are processed in command-line order.  If file
     is a single dash (`-') or absent, cat reads from the standard input.  If
     file is a UNIX domain socket, cat connects to it and then reads it until
     EOF.  This complements the UNIX domain binding capability available in
     inetd(8).

EXIT STATUS
     The cat utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     The command:

           cat file1

     will print the contents of file1 to the standard output.

STANDARDS
     The cat utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.2-1992 (``POSIX.2'')
     specification.

HISTORY
     A cat utility appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.  Dennis Ritchie designed
     and wrote the first man page.  It appears to have been cat(1).
