Hello and welcome to our game!

You are a cat newly adopted by Gertrude, a crotchety old cat lady who loves nothing more than yelling at kids on her lawn and tending her garden. However, lately some birds have invaded her flower patch and are eating them. She's tried putting out bird feeders but to no avail. She and her long-time companion and cat, Maximus, have adopted new cats to try and curb the bird problem.

We hope you have fun,
	Gus, Kevin, and Matt


Dear KevKev,
	Instead of Matt including a man page for each command, some cats could describe how the commands work and explain how to play more.
Best,
	Gus
	
Dear Matt,
	Please write the command descriptions for KevKev to implement.
Thanks,
	Gus
	
Dear Gus,
	I'm a little confused by what you mean? For example, do you mean something like having cat 6 descibe what the cat command did or something like that?
	Kevin

Dear Kevin,
	Yes. So if you talked to a cat they would describe a command. Cat 2 might describe ls while cat 4 might describe cd.
	Or just repeat what the tutorial says.
Yours,
	Gus
