Cats still needed:
	Cat 3, the neat freak
	Cat 4, the friend
	Cat 5, the trickster
	Cat 7, the angry one
Ideas: (Put input or ideas if you have any)
	Cat 5:  You can ask for help and a random number out of ten is given. 1-5 will cause you to loose halve the birds you got that day.
		6-8 don't do causes nothing to happen and 9 or 10 multiplies your birds by 1.5
	Cat 3: You can give him birds to ask for different commands that need to be used.
	Cat 4: Very simple. A random function that is called and gives a 50/50 chance of getting another random call for 1-5 birds(isn't a 20% chance for each).
	Cat 7: If you don't answer one of his questions the way he likes it, he screams and causes all the birds to fly away from the nests for that day.
