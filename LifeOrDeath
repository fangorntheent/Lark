Winner:
I'm so happy you survived! Over these past two weeks I've been so impressed by your una${CYAN}bash${NC}ed curiosity and bravery. 
You have proven yourself to be a fair and fearless feline who is worthy of my love. 
As such, you are now allowed in and out of the house whenever you want. Also, you can come and stop by for a crumpet and tea whenever you’re hungry or thirsty. 
See you soon!

Loser:
Oh no, another cat gone, what a tragedy! Your una${CYAN}bash${NC}ed curiosity and stupidity didn’t seem to help you too much in your survival. 
Well, maybe in your next life you’ll live past the two-week mark. Cats have 9 lives after all, right? 
Now, where can I put this disgusting, lifeless thing?
